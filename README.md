Android Developer Task - Scouto
Garage Application

(1) Android Studio, Language Used - JAVA.

(2) Included all mentioned features.
(3) Used Room Database to store data into local storage. It's simplifies the process of storing and retrieving data in Android applications by providing an abstraction layer over SQLite. It offers simplicity, performance, type safety, integration with other Android components, and flexibility.
(4) Retrofit is used to call API data in Android Studio as it provides an easy-to-use, customizable, and type-safe interface for making HTTP requests. It supports asynchronous requests and integrates well with other Android libraries.
(5) XML is used to design the UI. All activities are interactive and user friendly.
1)	Developed the app in XML and Java. (as mentioned in the description).
2)	Retrofit is used to call the API data because 
•	It efficiently manages the process of receiving, sending, and creating HTTP requests and responses.
•	Easy to use.
•	Android recommendation.
3)	Database – I used Room Database because It is easily implemented when used to store data locally. Room database provides an easier connection between the database and objects.
4)	Design Choices – Did not have much time to make attractive the app. So I used simple design choices to complete the work efficiently and fastly.
•	I used Constraint Layout in the MainActivity. In which I used TextView, Spinner, Button, and Recycler View (Because it uses less memory to display components means it used only memory which is used to display on the screen, that is why I use Recycler view).
•	Sign Up and Log In – I used the Linear Layout because the design objects need to arrange in linear and vertical order so I used linear layout.
